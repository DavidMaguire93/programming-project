# Project Description
This project contains a Jupyter Notebook and relevent files for the running of the Notebook. The Jupyter Notebook is:
 - daproject.ipynb: a Notebook on using numpy.random to produce a real life dataset of sleeping metrics


***

# Installing the required packages

This project was made with Anaconda version 2020.11. Some packaged may be auto installed on this version that do not come with regular python. Please see below a list of required packages:

numpy
matplotlib.pyplot
